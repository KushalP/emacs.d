#+TITLE: Kushal's Emacs Configuration

* What is this?

This is my Emacs config. It's my editor of choice and this is the
configuration I tend to use.

* Old version

The previous Emacs config I used for about 3 years can be found at
[[https://www.github.com/KushalP/emacs-starter-kit][KushalP/emacs-starter-kit]].

It was based on the excellent [[github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit][technomancy/emacs-starter-kit]] and this
configuration still takes a lot of what I learnt from it.

* Using it

To use this configuration, run it with Emacs 23 or greater. Cloning
the repository and using it as your Emacs config directory should be
enough to get going. Alternatively, use it globally by cloning it into
=~/.emacs.d=.
